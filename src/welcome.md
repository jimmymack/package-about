# Welcome to Valhalla!

Here is what you need to know.

1. If you only remember one thing make it `cmd-shift-P` (or `ctrl-shift-P` on Windows and Linux). This keystroke toggles
   the command palette, which lists every command.

2. Each Valhalla instance will only be around for 15 minutes in Alpha!

3. You have root access, and can run anything.

4. Changes you make to the instance will not be saved!
