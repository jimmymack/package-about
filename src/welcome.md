# Welcome to the MimirIDE!

Here is what you need to know.

1. Your user has root access, and can run anything (including apt-get's)

2. Your instance will not last forever, but your files in your home directory are persistent! There is a hard time limit. If you exit the instance, your instance may be recycled, and everything but your home directory cleared!

4. Changes you make to the instance will not be saved unless they are in your home directory (/home/{your first name})! This directory is your workspace, and it is persistent

5. To view web projects, start a server and select Toggle Port 80 under the View menue
